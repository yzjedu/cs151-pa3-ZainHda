The point of this: The point of this project was for us to keep getting used to using functions I belive.

Things I liked: I liked the artistic part of this project, It was pretty fun making circles and diamonds and different shapes.

Issues: I had so many issues. I had so much trouble making this. I dont understand what it means when it says  SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence '\ '
  print(" /   \ ") 
Overall: I think this would be a fun lab for me If i was able to complete it better. It was pretty hard for me to be honest.
